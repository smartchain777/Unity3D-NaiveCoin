# Unity3D-NaiveCoin
Bitcoin-like PoW blockchain made from scratch with Unity3D and C#

Unity3D-NaiveCoin is a port of the well-known NaiveCoin tutorial (https://lhartikk.github.io/)
<br/>Code was rewriten in an object-oriented manner with mono behaviour objects (each block is a game object).
<br/>It simulates 3 nodes in a 2D scene showing the mining process and allowing to send transactions between nodes.

I also added concurrent mining and an interruption mechanism when a block is received.

Feel free to use it as a playground to understand what a blockchain is about :)
